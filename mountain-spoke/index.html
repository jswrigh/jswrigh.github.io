        <h2>Come and Ride With Us!</h2>
      <p>Bozeman Mountain Bikes is, according to reliable urban legend, the oldest cycling shop in Montanna. Unless you can prove otherwise, the first Bozeman Mountain Bike was sold to a Pony Express Rider whose horse was too tired to finish the trip to Linvingston. Company history gets a little fuzzy after that but picks up again in 1987 when Paul Rockwell established Mountain Spoke Bikes. Cycling must be in the Rockwell blood because Paul Junior (also known as Pauly but don't call him that to his face) opened Bozeman Mountain Bikes downtown in 2007. Father and son have a friendly rivalry going on but don't feel bad for either one of them. They are both doing well and cater to different markets. Paul Sr. sells all kinds of bikes to all kinds of riders. Paul Jr. wants everyone to become hard-core mountain bike cyclists. Whether you are already one or are just willing to let Pauly (oops!) convert you, come on down to the store so we can meet you!</p>

         <h2>We Have Your Bike!</h2>
     <p>It's the time of year when riders decide to trade up to a new bike. If that's you, come on in and get the best deal on a trade-in. If you are looking for a used bike, now really is the best time to do it. We have cycles for every age, skill level, and budget.</p>

         <h2>Don't Miss the Family Ride!</h2>
       <p>Bozeman Mountain Bikes and Mountain Spokes are proud to sponsor the area's only cycling event created especially for families. We kicked it off in 2008 and have some awesome plans to celebrate the tenth anniversary. Mark your calendar and get ready to enjoy:</p>
        <ul class="ride-list">
            <li>Free water and Gatorade</li>
            <li>Free Tees for kids under ten</li>
            <li>Special discounts on themed jerseys for adults</li>
            <li>Awesome door prizes including a Shimano mountain bike!</li>
            <li>A chance to make new friends</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The ride starts at 8:00am on September 23rd but you can arrive as early as 6:30am if you need to register on site. Skip the line, though, by dropping by the store and signing up there. We'll even give you a ticket to drop in the bowl on ride day for the door prizes. Better yet...</p>
